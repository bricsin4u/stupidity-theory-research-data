The General Theory of Stupidity

This paper presents a formal mathematical model of the integral "Stupidity" indicator ($G$) — a metric assessing the probability of irrational behavior (cognitive failure) of an agent under the influence of information load. Unlike traditional theories linking rationality to general intelligence ($g$-factor), stupidity is defined here as an architectural vulnerability arising from an imbalance between environmental complexity and **attention control mechanisms**. The model introduces three fundamental components: (1) the separation of cognitive biases into stochastic errors ($B_{err}$) and motivated beliefs ($B_{mot}$), which are resistant to intelligence; (2) an exponential penalty function for digital overload ($D_{eff}$); and (3) the attention control factor ($A$) as the key regulator of rationality in the information economy. Simulation modeling on synthetic agents demonstrates the model's ability to identify "smart stupidity" scenarios that remain invisible to linear $IQ$ metrics.

The "Smart Stupidity" Paradox

The model resolves the contradiction observed by Stanovich (2009): why do smart people believe in irrational concepts?

Research results show that the component $B_{mot}$ (motivated reasoning) is **orthogonal to intelligence**. Moreover, high $IQ$ can serve as a tool for generating more complex arguments in defense of erroneous beliefs (rationalization effect), which makes the "smart fanatic" a more dangerous agent ($G \approx 0.65$, but with high impact) than a simple ignoramus.
